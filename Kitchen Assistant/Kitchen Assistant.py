## TO DO ##
# Use a data class
# Ingredients inherit from a class?
# Put recipes in a separate file and read it in
# Use Pandas to store recipes

# Allow user to enter their own recipes
# Allows user to enter their shopping
# Asks the user how much of an ingredient they have in order to fulfill the top 3 recipes

# Function that suggests ingredient swaps to reduce recipe price
# Ingredient price changes with the season (4 prices per item?)
# Takes the users climate zone into account
