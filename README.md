# Random-Projects
A bunch of fun project done in my spare time


**Project: Tic Tac Toe**

A Python library, which remains agnostic about the possible ways of presenting the game to the user in a graphical form. The library contains the core logic of the game and two artificial players. Then creating a sample front end to collect user input from the keyboard and visualize the game in the console using plain text

To start: $ python -m console

Development:

1. Implement the low-level details of the tic-tac-toe library

      1.0. Model the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Domain: identify the parts that make up the game and implement them using an object-oriented approach. By modeling the domain of the game with immutable objects results in modular and composable code thatâ€™s easier to test, maintain, debug, and understand
  
2. Use these to implement a higher-level game front end in a bottom-up fashion

frontends/  is to house one or more concrete game implementations. Contains the __main__.py file, making it a runnable Python package from the command line

library/ is the home folder for the game library 

  tic_tac_toe.game/ a scaffolding designed to be extended by front ends
  
  tic_tac_toe.logic/ the building blocks of the game
  
  pyproject.toml file contains the metadata necessary for building and packaging the library
