# Random-Projects
A bunch of fun project done in my spare time


Project: Tic Tac Toe

A Python library, which remains agnostic about the possible ways of presenting the game to the user in a graphical form. The library contains the core logic of the game and two artificial players. Then creating a sample front end to collect user input from the keyboard and visualize the game in the console using plain text

1. Implement the low-level details of the tic-tac-toe library
2. Use these to implement a higher-level game front end in a bottom-up fashion
